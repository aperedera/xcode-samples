/**
 * This is our naive native Swift structure.
 *
 * In C you can pack structures for different alignment.  We do this in c_code.h. 
 * If #pragma pack(2) is used, then the unsafe conversion, i.e. casting 
 * UnsafeMutableRawPointer to UnsafeMutablePointer<MyStruct> and using .pointee
 * to get MyStruct, will yield corrupted data.
 *
 * This structure is handy to use when callbacks take APIStruct *, as is or
 * as void *, as an IN parameter, i.e. the pointer is not used to send info
 * back to the C code.  If it's an INOUT parameter and we need to modify it 
 * to communicate back to C, then MyStructUnsafe can be used, with the 
 * disadvantage that we have to worry about object lifetime.
